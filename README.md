# 8Puzzle-Solver

The 8 Puzzle game consists of a board with 3 rows and 3 columns made up of tiles, numbered 1-8. One spot is left empty, so the player can slide the tiles around the board. The objective of the game is to slide the tiles around the board until you get to the goal state. 

My 8 Puzzle Solver C++ program uses the A* Algorithm to find a path from an initial state to the goal state. Upon finding the goal state, the program prints a success message and the path of moves the player must take to arrive at the goal state.
